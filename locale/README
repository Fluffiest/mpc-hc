Here you can find the diff files for the repository to apply language changes.

How to apply one of these diffs:
 - take care you checked out the right svn rev.
 - duplicate your svn repository (do not use the diff against your local svn, or you
   will no longer be able to sync with HEAD-revision)
 - use the GNU patch program
 - compile everything
